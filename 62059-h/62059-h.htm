<h2><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>CHAP.
I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was on a dull, cold evening that
Peter Lacy, a poor labourer, having finished the clump of turf
which he had engaged to do, put on his ragged coat, and walked up
to the door of his employer to receive his wages.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have no silver at present,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;but
come next Monday, and you shall be paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was three miles to his home, and, on his way, he passed the
cabin of a poor man whom he knew very well.&nbsp; There was a
little garden before it, and every thing looked clean and
decent.&nbsp; It was true the family who lived there were very
poor, and met with many crosses; but, let what would happen,
Michael Connor and his wife were always cheerful, and were never
heard to complain, because they were sure that nothing happens by
chance, having read in the Bible, that not even a sparrow falleth
to the ground without the knowledge of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Lacy to himself,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s the comfort of a quiet wife!&nbsp; Mary
Connor is always good tempered and mild; while my Susan is for
making bad worse, by her crying and scolding at every
hand&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp; A dry morsel with a quiet house, is
better than plenty of provision with grumbling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lacy
did not know that Solomon had said nearly the same: for Lacy
never read the Bible; and as for going to prayers, he left it to
those who had a better coat than his to put on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well neighbour,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;how does the
world jog with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on three legs,&rdquo; said Lacy,
&ldquo;for &rsquo;tis money makes the mare to go, and money I
have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could help you,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;but
I got my week&rsquo;s wages yesterday, and lent them to Wilson,
whose wife is sick in bed: he was to pay me to-day, but went home
without thinking of it; however, walk in and rest
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Mary
welcomed her husband with smiles, and had made the room very neat
against his return.&nbsp; The table was scoured as clean as sand
and water could make it; the hearth was nicely swept, and the
dinner was over the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come sit down,&rdquo; said the good-natured Connor,
&ldquo;eat an egg, and Mary shall put a bit of bacon on the
gridiron that we bought the other day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
no,&rdquo; replied Lacy, &ldquo;keep it for your dinner
to-morrow, you will have but a poor meal at best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary understood what he meant: she hung down her head for a
minute; but then looking cheerful again, she said, &ldquo;If you
have not got the money, my dear, we must do the best we
can&mdash;while God sends us health, and thankful hearts, we need
not complain at the want of a meal&rsquo;s meat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a good woman, Mrs. Connor,&rdquo; said Lacy;
&ldquo;my Susan will give me no such comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;you do not encourage
her to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Encourage,&rdquo; replied Lacy; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know what you mean by that&mdash;I work hard all the week, never
spending a farthing at the public house on Saturdays, and on
Sundays we have a snug, piping hot dinner, and a glass of punch
into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you pass the evening?&rdquo; asked
Connor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; says Lacy; &ldquo;Susan, perhaps,
puts on her cloak, and goes to Nancy Dillon, while her good man
and I smoke a pipe quietly together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you never go to prayers?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I do, now and then,&rdquo; replied Lacy,
&ldquo;and Susan goes whenever she gets a new riband to her old
hat, to make her look decent.&nbsp; Indeed she went twice, to my
certain knowledge, the day that his Honour&rsquo;s housekeeper
gave her the new stuff gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary shook her head, and Lacy was displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May be,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you think we are not
religious, as you call it; but I&rsquo;ll be bound we&rsquo;re as
good Christians as those that make such a fuss about it.&nbsp; I
learned the ten commandments when I was a boy, and remember them
well enough to keep them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think keeping the commandments in the sort
of way you talk of, will bring you to heaven?&rdquo; said
Connor.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;Indeed I do,&rdquo; replied Lacy, &ldquo;what else
should bring me there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you sure,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;that you
keep the commandments, and never break one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s myself that thinks so,&rdquo; said Lacy,
&ldquo;and I defy you, or any one else, to say to the
contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will show you presently,&rdquo; said Connor, taking
down a neat Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No thank you,&rdquo; said Lacy, &ldquo;I could have
enough of that if I liked it; but I am not fond of preaching:
it&rsquo;s poor feeding for those who want bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the Bible said to be the bread of
life?&rdquo; cried Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
live on a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, neighbour, if you would but learn to look up to
God!&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pho!&rdquo; replied Lacy, rising, and throwing his
spade over his shoulder, &ldquo;Connor, with all your talk, you
are worse off than me&mdash;how will you feed those four hungry
little ones to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t fret ourselves much about that,&rdquo;
said Mary, for &ldquo;He that feedeth the young ravens, has
promised that he will not suffer the children of his servants to
cry for food in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they do,&rdquo; added Connor, &ldquo;we can
fast: the Son of God knew hunger and thirst for <i>many</i> days,
and shall we grumble if he lets us feel them for
<i>one</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lacy could not think of any answer beyond &ldquo;good
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he walked home his temper got worse: he
wondered why Connor should cant like a preacher; and he thought
Mary&rsquo;s content was all pretence; but as it made her so
quiet, he wished his Susan could learn it.</p>
<p>People often bring on a quarrel by seeming to expect
one.&nbsp; When Susan saw him she ran with joyful looks saying,
&ldquo;Oh, Peter!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got the nicest plan for
to-morrow!&mdash;But, how sulky you are!&nbsp; What is the
matter?&mdash;Where is the tea?&nbsp; Why, you look as black as
that cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, wife,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I am the cloud,
and you are the thunder&mdash;there&rsquo;s neither tea, nor
potatoes, nor money to buy them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No money?&mdash;Where are your wages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman hadn&rsquo;t silver or brass in his
company,&rdquo; said Lacy, &ldquo;so now begin to
scold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; screamed Susan, &ldquo;you are
always picking a quarrel with me, because you find me so easy <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>with you.&nbsp;
No wages! no tea!&mdash;and you to be sent home without a penny
in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on in this way for a long time; then looking at a
parcel which lay carefully folded up, on a chair, her voice grew
very sad, and she whined out,&mdash;&ldquo;There!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been working my poor fingers to the bone this
live-long day! and I&rsquo;ve turned my gown from top to bottom,
till it looks as good as new; and I was going to ask Nancy Dillon
to drink tea, and walk out among the neighbours, and
all&mdash;but I am an unhappy creature, and you are a wicked, bad
man to do so.&rdquo;&nbsp; When, just as her voice was lost with
crying and scolding, the door opened, and Connor came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask pardon,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for coming in so
smart to ye: but I ran all the way, to ask ye to come and dine
with us to-morrow&mdash;Wilson brought the money, and we shall
have a bit of meat for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan dried her eyes, unfolded her stuff gown, and
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you kindly,&rdquo; said Lacy,
&ldquo;but you have so many of your own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; replied Connor&mdash;&ldquo;the more
the merrier; come early, and go to prayers with us.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAP. II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">How</span> pleasant is the Sabbath! and
how good is God, who not only allows, but demands for the
humblest of his creatures, a day of rest&mdash;the poor horse who
dragged the heavy plough all the week, now crops the grass at his
ease, or draws a mouthful of hay from the crib.&nbsp; The patient
ass who drew many a basket of turf to the town, now rambles by
the side of the road, and feeds on the thistles in the
hedge.&nbsp; I hope there are no children so cruel as to teaze
and torment him.&nbsp; &ldquo;God is the Maker of all
creatures,&rdquo; said Michael Connor to his little boys,
&ldquo;and he will punish those who wantonly hurt even the poor
ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter Lacy came, with his wife, in good time for the morning
prayers.&nbsp; Susan looked very smart, and held up her head; but
Mary did not seem a bit less happy than she did.&nbsp; Mary had
no gay stuff gown, but one of plain blue check; with a black
bonnet, which looked new because it was carefully kept, and not
tossed about <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>and dirtied.&nbsp; She learned from her Bible that pride
is hateful to God, and that the ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit is what He loves, and fitter for a Christian woman than
the plaiting the hair, and putting on of rich apparel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Indeed it is melancholy,&rdquo; she would often say,
&ldquo;to behold a poor body, made from the dust of the earth,
and returning to it again, pampered and puffed up, as if it was a
great thing in the sight of God; while the immortal soul is left
neglected; and, if found unprepared to meet the Judge at the last
day, together with the naked, shivering body, will be sentenced
to be cast into the lake of eternal fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon set out for prayers, and the two eldest boys went
with them.</p>
<p>Lacy could not help observing how devoutly Connor and Mary
joined in the whole service: he looked and wondered; he could not
feel as they did, nor pray like them, but he wished to do so; nor
was he disappointed in the end:&mdash;God, who sees the heart of
man, and knows all his thoughts, will answer the humble prayers
of a soul that begins to feel his own sinfulness, and the want of
a Saviour; the effect of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s influence on
those that seek Him.</p>
<p>All this time Susan was looking about her; but though there
was not so smart a gown in that place, very few minded the
pattern.</p>
<p>In his sermon, the clergyman spoke like a father to his
children.&nbsp; Among other things, he told them in particular,
&ldquo;how sinful and how ignorant they were by nature, and how
useless all endeavours of their own to please God must be, unless
they come to Him by his Son,&rdquo; (John xiv. 6.) through whose
blood alone they could be cleansed from all sin, and clothed in
the wedding garment of the Saviour&rsquo;s
righteousness.&mdash;That they must be taught of God to feel the
plague of their own hearts, and loathe sin.&nbsp; That being
brought to a sense of their lost state, and to an entire
dependence upon the merits of their Saviour, and upon them alone,
for pardon, they should, seeking the blessing humbly in
God&rsquo;s appointed way, receive the gift of a new heart; their
former inclinations and sinful ways being exchanged for godly
desires and holy pursuits, and they should become &ldquo;new
creatures.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, &ldquo;if any man be in Christ, he
is a <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>new
creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are
become new.&rdquo; 2 Cor. v. 17.</p>
<p>He spoke also of what followed upon this great change, of the
fruits of this conversion from sin unto righteousness, how the
true Christian was full of tenderness to his fellow-creatures,
&ldquo;and loved his neighbour as himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He showed
that they could not any longer allow themselves to give way to
their passions; in particular, he mentioned the evil nature of
anger, which Christians must entirely forsake; and that provoking
to anger was a thing equally bad.</p>
<p>It was a discourse that went to Lacy&rsquo;s very heart: he
would have given the world to have understood it better; and as
for his wife, she, for once, forgot her gown while she listened
to the sermon.</p>
<p>Lacy and Susan asked no questions till after dinner, when
Connor had very devoutly returned thanks to God for all the good
things he sent them.&nbsp; At last he said, &ldquo;Connor, did
you understand the sermon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, through God&rsquo;s blessing, I trust I
did,&rdquo; replied Connor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I listened all through,&rdquo; said Lacy,
&ldquo;but could make out very little of what he meant, except
when he spoke about anger, and such other evil passions,&rdquo;
looking at Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of provoking to anger,&rdquo; said Susan, looking
at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you not understand what he said about loving
one another?&rdquo; asked Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I think so,&rdquo; replied Lacy; &ldquo;but
what did he mean by our coming to Christ to be cleansed and
clothed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He meant,&rdquo; answered Connor, &ldquo;as the Bible
shows, that nothing could wash away our sins but the blood that
was shed on the cross for us&mdash;and that renouncing all
dependence upon our own works, we must take for the garment of
salvation, the righteousness of Christ, which alone can make us
fit to appear before God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;there were some
very wicked people there, and the clergyman meant it for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said Connor, &ldquo;and for the very best
people there too;&mdash;there are none in the world fit to enter
heaven without being so cleansed and so clothed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is odd!&rdquo; exclaimed Lacy, &ldquo;for
supposing that you and I, and the two wives, are all sinners,
sure the little boys cannot be sinners?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Oh, yes we are, indeed?&rdquo; said little
William, shaking his head sorrowfully, &ldquo;Peter and I are bad
boys: I told a lie twice; and Peter pulled an apple that father
told him not to touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor dears!&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;and do you think
such little trifles will keep you out of heaven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All sin will do so,&rdquo; said Connor; &ldquo;a small
penknife will destroy life, as well as a great sword; they knew
it was wrong, yet they did it, and that was sin.&nbsp; Little as
they are, they already feel the want of pardon for their sin,
through the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lacy felt somewhat alarmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If this be
true,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;what a vile sinner am
I!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned his head on his hand, for some time; then striking
the table, he exclaimed, &ldquo;I shall never understand all
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good neighbour, it <i>cannot</i> be learned without the
grace of God to teach us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How may a body get that grace?&rdquo; said Lacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By praying for it,&rdquo; replied Mary; &ldquo;we
should often say, &lsquo;Lord teach us to pray.&rsquo;&nbsp; Our
Saviour says, &lsquo;Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise
cast out.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ask and ye shall receive, that your
joy may be full;&rsquo; &lsquo;seek and ye shall find, knock and
it shall be opened unto you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will praying teach me every thing,&rdquo; said
Lacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holy Spirit will teach you,&rdquo; replied Connor,
&ldquo;to understand what you read in the Bible, and hear on the
Sabbath.&nbsp; When we read the Scriptures let our prayer be,
&lsquo;Lord, open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
things out of thy law.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if I had time, I would read the Bible,&rdquo;
said Lacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot you read it, as I do, of an evening after work,
and on Sundays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lacy, &ldquo;I am too tired at night to
bother myself with book learning; and Sunday is the only day I
have for making merry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus does Satan try to smother the first sparks of conviction
in our hearts, and make us unwilling to strive for a
blessing.</p>
<p>Lacy and Susan thought themselves excellent Christians for
having been to prayers; and in the labour of the week they soon
forgot the warning voice of the clergyman and of Connor.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAP.
III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next Sunday at breakfast, Lacy
said, &ldquo;Will you go to prayers, Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;I think I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So will I,&rdquo; replied Lacy, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t
it look like rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure the clouds are blackish,&rdquo; answered
Susan; &ldquo;but perhaps it may clear up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lacy yawned, stretched himself, lighted his pipe, and fell
into a fit of thinking.&nbsp; An hour after, he said, looking out
at the door, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too late now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your fault,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;I was
willing to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lacy was about making a sharp reply, but recollecting what the
clergyman had said about provoking one another to anger, he held
his tongue; and when Susan went out of the room he felt as proud
as if he had killed a lion; for nothing is so pleasant as
thinking we have been enabled to overcome a bad
inclination.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I shall
get very good now, after this, by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan now came back with her gown, and hung it before the
fire, for the weather had been damp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your nasty pipe out of the way,&rdquo; said she to
her husband, &ldquo;or my gown will be spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fuss you make about your gown,&rdquo; replied
he; &ldquo;it would be well if you thought as much of washing my
shirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I say you
shan&rsquo;t smoke my gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I say I&rsquo;ll do as I like, wife,&rdquo; replied
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tobacco won&rsquo;t hurt your gown&mdash;look
here,&rdquo; and he was so mischievous as to let some of the
ashes fall on it.</p>
<p>Susan cried out, snatched his pipe, broke it, and threw the
pieces at him.</p>
<p>This was too much for Lacy&rsquo;s patience, though he was not
often passionate: he seized the gown, and running to the door,
tossed it into the mud that lay in the front of the house.</p>
<p>Much altercation here ensued&mdash;Lacy ran out of the
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;if we had gone
to prayers this would not have happened.&rdquo;&nbsp; He felt
ashamed of having taken such a revenge on his wife, after
provoking her as he did; but he was too stubborn to go back and
be friends with her.&nbsp; He walked on towards Connor&rsquo;s
cabin, and as he passed the door he plainly heard the sobs of a
woman within.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Such a
sound was very strange in that happy and quiet place&mdash;he
stopped at the door, and heard Mary sob out&mdash;&ldquo;I know,
I know, he will protect them:&mdash;preserve them&mdash;but my
life&mdash;my husband!&rdquo;&nbsp; She could say no more, and
Lacy entered.</p>
<p>There, on his humble bed, lay poor Connor! death was pictured
in his face; his cheeks were pale, his lips blue, his eyes
hollow: he looked now on his wife and children, and seemed full
of grief, but then he looked up to heaven, and was comforted.</p>
<p>Mary sat beside him: her apron was drenched in her tears; she
tried to hide her sorrow and to quiet her sobs, but she could
not: her eyes were searching about every where, as if for some
comfort; but when she saw the altered face of her husband, she
almost went distracted, and could only, like him, look up to God
in humble submission.</p>
<p>William sat on his low stool with his little sister on his
lap, Peter was crying by his mother&rsquo;s knee, and the baby
was asleep in the cradle.</p>
<p>William was the first who saw Lacy, and trying to speak he
burst into sobs and cries.</p>
<p>His father turned slowly his eyes towards him, and saw Lacy; a
look of satisfaction appeared on his countenance, and then Mary
saw him too.</p>
<p>Her grief broke out again, &ldquo;Oh, neighbour, neighbour, he
is dying!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; Lacy could not speak a
word, but he shook her by the hand, and then leaned over
Connor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lacy,&rdquo; said the poor man, in a weak
voice, &ldquo;you wonder to see me thus&mdash;you left me well
and hearty lost night, but a carriage was run away with, and the
horses went over me; I am dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go for a doctor,&rdquo; cried Lacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been here&mdash;there is no hope.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Connor spoke these words calmly, but they seemed to cut Mary to
the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hope, no hope,&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;he must
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t die, father,&rdquo; said little Peter, in a
piteous voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, father, father, surely you are
not going to leave us!&rdquo; sobbed William; &ldquo;who will
teach us the Bible, or show us the way to heaven any
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could, O Lord teach me!&rdquo; exclaimed Lacy,
and he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that prayer!&rdquo; cried the pious
Connor.&nbsp; <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;I know he hears it, and I trust his Holy Spirit
will lead you to Jesus, my friend, and teach you to lead others
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot,&rdquo; said Lacy, in an agony, &ldquo;I am
too vile, too sinful, too wicked, he cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will,&rdquo; replied Connor fervently, &ldquo;if you
are now sensible of sin, and feel the need of a Saviour, you will
find him; and your dying hour will be as peaceful as
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lacy was quite overcome: he sat down, covered his face, and
wept.&nbsp; Even Mary spared a look of kindness from her dying
husband to the awakened sinner.</p>
<p>The clergyman had been sent for, and now came in: he looked
with concern on poor Connor, who forgot his own sufferings, and
pointing to Lacy, said, &ldquo;Comfort him,&rdquo; then whispered
Mary to send for Susan.</p>
<p>The clergyman touched Lacy&rsquo;s shoulder, and said,
&ldquo;My friend, raise yourself, and behold the instructive
scene&mdash;the death-bed of a Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed, and came near the bed with those who had arrived to
visit their dying neighbour; for Connor was loved, or at least
respected by all who knew him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Connor to the clergyman, &ldquo;I
trust that my sins, which are many and great, are
forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin,&rdquo;
replied the clergyman, &ldquo;only believe, and thou shalt see
the glory of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; cried Connor, &ldquo;I feel it, I
leave my wife and children; but my Saviour I cannot leave; to him
I cling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he will support you,&rdquo; replied the clergyman,
&ldquo;through the dark valley of the shadow of death.&nbsp; This
is no late death-bed repentance; you, my brother, sought the Lord
and he was found of you: you came to Jesus for help, when health
and strength were your own, and he will not leave nor forsake you
now in your distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet I cannot help feeling some anxiety,&rdquo; said
Connor, &ldquo;when I remember that the years I passed in sinful
blindness of heart, are far more than the days in which I strove
to walk with God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the gracious promise of our God,&rdquo; replied
the Clergyman, &ldquo;to his believing people, that their sins
and iniquities he will remember no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan now came in, but was too much shocked to speak.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Connor to Mary, &ldquo;cherish that
poor <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>couple, and with God&rsquo;s help strive to assist them
in their way to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was now going apace: they all kneeled down and joined the
clergyman in prayers for the dying man.</p>
<p>Connor uttered some faint sounds&mdash;Mary bent to hear them;
his words were, &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer liveth,&rdquo; and
they were his last.</p>
<p>The poor widow arose: dreadful was the struggle between the
repinings of nature and pious resignation, but the latter
prevailed: she raised her clasped hands and said, &ldquo;The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the name of the
Lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan looked at her: she recollected her own sinful passion
and resentment on her late trifling loss; she condemned herself,
she knew that she could never make her own peace with God, and
for the first time in her life she felt the want of a
Mediator.</p>
<p>The good clergyman pointed to the corpse, and said,
&ldquo;There is a lesson never to be forgotten: he was of the
world: he was in darkness, until it pleased God by the light of
his Holy Spirit to take away that darkness, and direct him to the
only sure refuge, the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; From that first
dawn it has shone more and more unto the perfect day.&nbsp; He
grew in grace, and prayed to be strengthened and confirmed in
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For him death had no terrors, but appeared the gate of
life: the grave only seemed to him like a dark passage, and he
looked beyond it to everlasting light and glory in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can behold the mild countenance of our departed
brother, and not exclaim, &lsquo;Let me die the death of the
righteous, and let my last end be like his!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Reader, may you thus live&mdash;thus die!!!</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
